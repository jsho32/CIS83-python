Description: We know that writing the following code:
        print ("I like writing in Python.")
        print ("It is so much fun.")
        will result in:
        I like writing in Python.
        It is so much fun.
when executed. However, can you manage to do this same task with only one line of
code?

# yes with \n
print("I like writing in python.\nIt is so much fun.")
