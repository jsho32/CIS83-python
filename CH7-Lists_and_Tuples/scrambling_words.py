Description: scramble words leaving first and last letters alone handle punctuation
Hints:
- Donâ€™t bother trying to scramble words fewer than four characters long.
- The string split method is useful to create a list of words from a string of words.
- The string strip method is useful to remove end-of-line characters and other
whitespace.
- To scramble a string, convert it to a list, use random.shuffle from the random
module to scramble the string, and then use the join string method to convert 
back to a string ".join(list)
