This paragraph was published as an example of a principle of human reading
comprehension. If you keep the first letter and the last letter of a word in their correct
positions and scramble the letters in between, the word is still quite readable in the
context of a surrounding paragraph. However, it seems that this is a bit of a myth and
not truly based on solid research. It turns out that for longer words, the task is much
more difficult. Nonetheless, we are going to imitate the process on some English text.
Handling punctuation is tricky. You need to deal with punctuation that comes at
the end of a word: comma, period, question mark, exclamation, etc. For example, in
the previous sample, the word university ends with a comma, so you need to ensure
that you do not treat the comma as the “last letter of the word” when you scramble all
but the first and last letters. This... is my, "extra-punctuated" sentence!
